              <p>
                Cache is a type of memory that allows for high-speed retrieval.
                With the cache memory, for example, you will be able to access
                information much quicker compared to reading the information
                directly from your hard disk. I know it might sound a bit
                abstract right now, but let me explain with the library analogy
                my Computer Science professor once taught.
              </p>
              <br /><br />

              <br /><br />
              <p>
                Imagine your hard disk memory (which stores all your information
                or data) is like a physical library and the books are your
                information. Everytime you wish to search for some data, you
                would need to look through the entire library, shelves after
                shelves, for that specific book. How inefficient! What’s worse
                is that you need to place the book back on the shelf before
                taking another book.
              </p>
              <br /><br />

              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                Now, how can we optimize this? What if you already know the
                books that you are likely to need and take all of them at once,
                and place them on a nearby desk? Wouldn’t that be much faster?
                And that is how cache works! The main idea is to keep the
                commonly used information in a smaller and faster memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just some more additional information, there are many types of
                cache, and a few examples are direct mapped cache, set
                associative cache and fully associative cache. I will not be
                covering these different caches in this article, but they mainly
                differ in the way they handle cache misses. I will share more
                about cache misses and subsequently the Least Recently Used
                (LRU) policy.

                Studio is 1101’s version of tutorial, which is another 2 hours
                of class and they are lessons conducted by Avengers (i.e. your
                Teaching Assistants, typically a Year 2 CS student). The lessons
                consist mostly of reviewing the studio worksheet (ungraded
                homework) and in-class worksheets.

              </div>
              <p>
                As the name suggests, the LRU policy suggests that you replace
                the block of memory (or book) that has not been accessed (or
                read) for the longest time. Let’s use an example to better
                understand this concept.
              </p>

                alt="LRU pic 1"

                Snapshot of the cache before any information is loaded into it
              </p>
              <br /><br />

              <p>
                We have an arbitrary order of memory access: m0, m4, m0, m8,
                m12, m here refers to the data from the hard disk.
              </p>

              <br /><br />
              <img
                src="../resources/post_pictures/inside_post_pictures/intro-to-cache/lru-2-min.jpg"
                alt="LRU pic 2"
                class="inside_post_img"
              />
              <p class="img_description">After the first two memory accesses</p>
              <br /><br />

              <p>
                Data from m0 is required, and it cannot be located in the cache
                as it is currently empty. As such, m0 from the hard disk is
                loaded into the cache and gets mapped to the first block.
                Likewise, m4 from the hard disk is loaded to the second block.
                This is pretty straightforward.
              </p>

              <br /><br />
              <img
                src="../resources/post_pictures/inside_post_pictures/intro-to-cache/lru-3-min.jpg"
                alt="LRU pic 3"
                class="inside_post_img"
              />
              <p class="img_description">After the next two memory accesses</p>
              <br /><br />

              <p>
                Then, we see m0 being accessed again. Luckily, this data is
                loaded into our cache and we need not load any new blocks from
                the hard disk. We continue to m8 which is then mapped to the
                third block.
              </p>

              <br /><br />
              <img
                src="../resources/post_pictures/inside_post_pictures/intro-to-cache/lru-4-min.jpg"
                alt="LRU pic 4"
                class="inside_post_img"
              />
              <p class="img_description">After the last memory accesses</p>
              <br /><br />

              <p>
                Now we are at maximum capacity and we need to evict a data block
                to make space for m12. By LRU policy, data at m4 should be
                replaced with m12 as it was not used for the longest time, not
                m0. Although m0 was loaded into the cache first, it is not the
                least recently used!
              </p>
              <p>
                While this policy might seem great, one major drawback is that
                it is difficult to keep track of which is the least recently
                used, especially if there are many sets of cache blocks. There
                are also other policies such as FIFO (first in first out) or LFU
                (least frequently used).
              </p>
              <h2 class="signposting">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                With that, I have covered the theoretical concept of cache and
                LRU. Hopefully you found this article helpful and with this new
                understanding, you might be able to crack the
