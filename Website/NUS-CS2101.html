              In this article, I will be sharing more about CS2101 Effective
              Communication for Computing Professionals, experiences taking the
              module and some takeaways. In short, CS2101 is a seminar-based
              communications module that is paired with

              skills when working in a team, presentation skills, communication
              frameworks like how to deliver proper feedback, how to write a
              client-centric user guide and more.

              </div>
              <p>
                My semester was the first semester since the start of Covid-19
                where class resumed to normal with face-to-face seminars. While
                this lifted the atmosphere and made lessons more engaging, there
                was a trade off. Our presentations, which consisted of the bulk
                of our grades, had to be live and we could no longer read off
                our scripts hidden behind our computer screens. As such, most of
                us had to spend quite a bit more time and effort memorising and
                practising our presentations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going into more details of the two presentations, the first one
                occurs in the first half of the semester. It consisted of 4
                topics to choose from - crafting a professional resume and cover
                letter, preparing for an interview, conflict management and
                building credibility in the workplace. Do note that your team
                for Oral Presentation 1 (OP1) is not the same as your CS2103T
                grouping. The second presentation takes place in the later half
                of the semester which is a demo or pitch about the application
                you are developing for CS2103T. This OP2 follows the same
                CS2103T group.

              <p>
                Just some quick tips for the presentations,
                <span class="highlight">do coordinate the dress code</span> with
                your teammates and wear something more formal. Don’t neglect the
                delivery and non-verbal cues as it makes your presentation more
                engaging and definitely makes you standout. Most importantly, as
                there is a fair amount of work to do for these presentations, do
                choose your group mates carefully! (You will be meeting quite
                often, at least once a week so do find people you can trust)
                Actually, I applied for my seminar slot with my friends but they
                did not get allocated the same slot and I ended up in the class
                not knowing anyone. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to find a
                group of really hard working and fun people for both my OPs,
                which made meetings a lot more enjoyable. Also bear in mind that
                there is a diversity rule when forming groups, where you need to
                have someone of different nationality and/ or gender (usually at
                least 1 female as most CS kids are males).
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, there are 2 essays or reflections that you would
                need to write. The first one is about your experience during one
                of your group meetings and the second one is about what you have
                learnt from this module or any insightful realisation. I believe
                the main aim of these essays are to encourage you to reflect on
                what you have experienced and hopefully discover areas that you
                can improve on in the aspect of communication. It would be good
                if you are able to build on and add to the concepts taught and
                <span class="highlight"
                  >go beyond simply repackaging and contextualising what was
                  shared in class</span
                >. My instructor also advised not to use overly complex words or
                sentence structures, like those you would use in an academic
                essay, and keep it easy to read and well organised.
              </p>

              <p>
                As for the rest of the assessment breakdown, the remaining parts
                are made up of the User Guide and of course, not forgetting
                class participation!
              </p>

              <div id="second_link">
                <h2 class="signposting">Documentation</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Moving on to the user guide and documentation, there are many
                ways we can document our code. At a fundamental level, adding
                comments inside our codebase that describe the “why” and “what”
                of the code (instead of the “how” as the workings of the code
                should be self explanatory) is a way to document and it speaks
                to future readers (yourself included) about the breakdown of
                code. This will help when revisiting your code after a couple of
                months or even help other developers who need to maintain your
                code. Another example of documentation is writing the API
                (Application Programming Interface) documentation that describes
                how to start using your code and some of its possibilities.
                Usually, only programmers read the API.

              <p class="img_description">Example of a User Guide</p>
              <br /><br />

              <p>
                However, the focus of CS2101 is on the documentation of the User
                Guide (UG). A User Guide is an instruction manual created for
                the users of the application to gain a better understanding of
                how to use your application. I have linked the user guide my
                team wrote for our project,
                <a
                  href="https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w16-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html"
                  >GuestBook, for your reference</a
                >! FYI, the same UG is graded for both CS2101 and CS2103T, so do
                it well!
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the CS2101 side, there is a strong emphasis on ensuring
                that the UG is
                <span class="highlight">reader-friendly and reader-focused</span
                >. I think this is where the concept of using Needs Analysis is
                really important, which helps us understand the context,
                audience and purpose of the UG. With that settled, to stand out
                more, it would be good if you could write creatively. You could
                use phrases like “Not to worry, we will walk you through
                step-by-step to better understand the core features of…” and to
                write as if you are speaking to the person reading the UG.
              </p>

              <h2 class="signposting">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                In conclusion, the general sentiment around this mod is that
                it's another fluff core module (like ES2660) and can and should
                be SU-ed. If you check NUSMODs, most of the reviews are
                negative. Many didn’t like the group forming process or felt the
                content was irrelevant to software engineers. However, I enjoyed
                it and learnt quite a bit! It is honestly one of the most chill
                computer science modules in NUS and a refreshing break from the
                intense technical mods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, I felt this mod helped me through my internship
                application process. I remember sharing what I have gleaned in
                this course during behavioural or human-resource interviews with
                larger companies. Unsurprisingly, by following the content of
                this module as a guideline when answering those questions, I
                could better showcase myself as a good cultural fit with the
                many companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long story short, try to take this mod with an open mind. I
                really did learn a lot from this module and I am sure you will
                see the value of this module as well. All the best!
