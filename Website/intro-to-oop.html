                    Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a systematic way of structuring project files using Classes. Python is one of the many languages that support OOP and is a great segway into the world of Classes! Using OOP will be able to make your code much more elegant and clean, which is something every programmer should strive for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In today’s article, I will define what exactly is OOP and why it’s so effective. In addition, I will also explain many functionalities of Python Classes while going through some real example code for you to really get a good understanding of Python Classes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope you are excited to dive into the world of OOP and improve your programming proficiency greatly!

                        Now, what exactly is Object-Oriented Programming? Think of it like a blueprint! Creating a Class is much like creating a blueprint for a type of object. Using this standard blueprint, we are able to create many objects of the same type! These blueprints can outline any kind of objects, making it very easy for us to define different kinds of Classes for different purposes!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you are programming the next great game, where your player is a mighty warrior fighting different kinds of enemies. In this game, the enemies should have a certain amount of health, be able to attack your player, deal a certain amount of damage etc. You can be creating a new orc enemy, a new giant enemy, they all should have a standard set of functions that they can do!
                    </p>
                    <div class="inside_post_img_container">
                        <img src="../resources/post_pictures/inside_post_pictures/python_oop/game-example-min.jpg" class="inside_post_img">
                        <p class="img_description">
                            In this article, let's imagine you are developing a role-playing game!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This would be a great place to introduce OOP into your code! We can create a Class for our enemies! This Enemy Class should be able to do all things that we want our Enemies to do, and have attributes that we want all our Enemies to have. For example, it should have a function to attack our player, receive damage, and have attributes like its health, its name etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now everytime we want to introduce an enemy into our game, we simply use our Enemy Class blueprint and create that enemy! This new enemy we created using the Enemy Class blueprint will then be able to do everything that we outlined an Enemy object can!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It may be a little confusing for now but don’t worry. As we go through real code examples further along this article, everything should clear up in no time. Now let’s get to how we write our blueprints in Python!
                    </p>

                    <a id="second_link">
                        <h2 class="signposting">Defining Classes</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        How do we define our Classes? It’s actually fairly simple! We simply use Python’s Class keyword. It’ll look something like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    Class ClassName:
        #Class code
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        When naming Classes in Python, most programmers follow a certain naming convention. For Python Classes, Class names are named using the <mark class="highlight">camel-case</mark> convention, which just means separating words by capitalizing the first letter of each word. For example, a name like “My Class” will be “MyClass” in camel-case!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s go back to programming our game. If you were to define your enemy class, it would look something like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    Class Enemy:
        #Class code
                        </code></pre>

                    <a id="third_link">
                        <h2 class="signposting">Class Methods & Variables</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        The true beauty of Classes can be seen when we introduce Class Methods and Variables! These adds functionality to our Python Classes and actually make them useful!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Defining a Class Method ensures that all our objects of the same class will be able to use the same method! For example, if we were to create Class Methods for our Enemy Class in our game, we would probably include Methods to deal damage to the player and to receive damage from the player. Defining these functions as Class Methods allow us to ensure all enemy objects can use these functions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
    def example_method(self):
        #Do something!
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Before we move on, let’s tackle this confusing “self” parameter. The “self” parameter actually just refers to the specific Class object that called the method! Another thing to take note of is that we don’t have to specifically name the parameter “self”, regardless of what we name it, it will refer to the same thing. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
        Def example_method(parameter_1, parameter_2, parameter_3):
            #Do something!
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Even though we did not define our first parameter in example_method as self, it will still refer to the specific Class object that called the method!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Defining a Class Variable ensures that each object of the same Class will have standard attributes! This would mean they would have the same variables as long as they belong to the same Class! For example, our enemy Class would probably need a variable to define how much health it has and how much damage it can deal! Defining health and damage within our enemy Class ensures that all our enemy objects will have these variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Defining a Class Variable will look exactly like defining variables in Python, just within a Class! It’ll look something like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
        class_variable = “Hello World!”
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        After defining our class_varaible, all objects of MyClass can now access this variable of value “Hello World!”
                    </p>

                    <a id="fourth_link">
                        <h2 class="signposting">Class Instances</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now that we know how to create our Classes, let’s finally move on to actually creating objects of certain Classes! These objects are known as Instances of the Class. Creating an Instance of a Class is very simple. The syntax looks exactly like calling a function!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
        #Class code
        #To define an Instance of MyClass:
        class_instance = MyClass()
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Now that we have created an instance of MyClass, we have access of its Class Methods and Variables too! We access these methods and variables simply by using the following syntax:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    #To call a method:
    class_instance.method()
    #To access a class variable:
    new_variable = class_instance.variable
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            It’s that simple! Now let’s bring it all back to our game development example once again. We create our enemy Class, with standard Class Variables and Methods that we want all Instances of our Enemy Class to have. It’ll probably look something like this:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    Class Enemy:
        #Defining class variables:
        damage= 10
        name = ‘Enemy’

        #Defining class methods:
        def deal_damage(self):
            message = name + “ has dealt “  +str(damage) + “ damage to the player!”
            print(message)
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Now if we were to create an Instance of our Enemy, it will have access to all Class Variables and methods we defined within our Enemy Class!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    enemy_1 = Enemy()

    print(enemy_1.name)
    #Output: “Enemy”

    print(enemy_1.health)
    #Output: 10

    enemy_1.deal_damage()
    #Output: “Enemy has dealt 10 damage to the player!”
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Now we can create multiple Instances of our Enemy class and they all will have access to the same variables and methods! How convenient!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    enemy_1 = Enemy()
    enemy_2 = Enemy()
    enemy_1.deal_damage()
    enemy_2.deal_damage()
    #Both lines will output the same message!
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            If you’ve been following along our game development example, there may be something that doesn’t quite sit right with you. We have our Enemy Class, we have our Enemy Class Methods and Variables, but doesn’t it seem a little redundant if every enemy has the same variables? For example, what if we wanted an enemy with more health, or a different name? This is where we introduce Instance Variables! But before that, I have to introduce another important concept, the __init__ method!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every Class in Python has a specific Class Method called an __init__ method! We define this method by naming a Class Method with the name __init__!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
        def __init__(self):
            #Init Method code
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            What’s special about __init__ is that it will run the moment an Instance of a Class is called! This means the moment I create an object of a Class, the Class’ __init__ method will trigger! For example:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
        def __init__(self):
            print(“Hello world!”)

    new_instance = MyClass()
    #This line will output “Hello world!” in the console!
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            With this new __init__ method, we can also create Instance variables! We create them by simply using the __init__ method to define them each time a new Instance of a Class is created! It’ll look something like this:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    Class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message
        print(self.message)
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            By taking a parameter in my __init__ method, I can define a Instance variable “message”. This means each time I Instantiate a new Instance of MyClass, I have to define a different “message” Instance variable!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    my_class_1 = MyClass(“Hello world!”)
    #This will output “Hello world!”

    my_class_2 = MyClass(“Goodbye world!”)
    #This will output “Goodbye world!”

                            A problematic concept programmers face is the difference between Instance and Class variables. The main difference is that Instance variables are specific to one instance of a Class, while Class variables are the same for all Instances of a Class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lets once again trot back to our game development example. I have my Enemy Class which is amazing! But now i want to be able to define different kinds of enemies with different values for name and damage! Tweaking our code a little will let us do just that.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    Class Enemy:
        #Defining Instance variables:
        def __init__(self, name, damage):
            self.name = name
            self.damage = damage

        #Defining class methods:
        def deal_damage(self):
            message = self.name + “ has dealt “  +str(self.damage) + “ damage to the player!”
            print(message)
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            With our new Enemy Class, we can define countless different kinds of Enemies! Take note that now that our “name” and “damage” variables are no longer Class variables, we have to change our code in the deal_damage() method a little. Instead of using “name” and “damage”, we have to access the Instance Variable “self.name” and “self.damage”!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let’s create a Minion Enemy and a hard-hitting Ogre Enemy for our player to battle!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    minion = Enemy(‘Minion’, 1)
    #This creates a Enemy instance with name ‘Minion’ and damage = 1!
    ogre = Enemy(‘Ogre’, 10)
    #This creates a Enemy instance with name ‘Ogre’ and damage = 10!
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Now with our different kinds of Enemy Instances with different Instance variables, they naturally will produce different outputs when we use their deal_damage() method!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    minion.deal_damage()
    #Output: “Enemy has dealth 1 damage to the player!”

    ogre.deal_damage()
    #Output: “Enemy has dealth 10 damage to the player!”
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Isn’t that Amazing? One simple Enemy Class can now built so many variants of enemies that all have their own names, damages and all can deal damage using the deal_damage() Class Method!
                        </p>
